# A-Database-for-Emotion-and-Aesthetic-Analysis-for-Chinese-Traditional-Paints
we introduce a new image aesthetic database for conducting Chinese paintings aesthetic and emotion analysis. 
The database contains over 500 images of Chinese paintings in 5 semantic categories of aesthetic, 
along with quantitative annotations of a three-dimensional emotion score and aesthetic quality for each image. 
To build basic data, 511 traditional Chinese paintings were collected and filtered as digital images from multiple sources (e.g., www.artsjk.com), 
350 adjectives were gathered through extensive provenances (e.g., Historical Dictionary of Aesthetics, classical documents in psycho-aesthetics, 
art aesthetics and philosophical aesthetics). Two methods were used in annotating Chinese paintings: discrete emotion model and PAD (pleasure-Arousal-Dominance) scale.

5 categories of aesthetics on traditional Chinese painting have been identified: 气势美（111 paints），清幽美（53 paints），生机美（187 paints），雅致美（103 paints），萧瑟美（43 paints）。
We believe this database can provide a data base for quantitative study in visual beauty, computer vision, affective computing and experimental aesthetics. 
Our future work includes expanding data of rare aesthetics, and conducting multi-label aesthetic classification based on PAD affective model of images in the database.
